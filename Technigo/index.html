                  <h2>Frontend explaination</h2>
                  <p>When it comes to computing and IT, the word <b>frontend</b> refers to what users see and interact with when visiting a web page. A frontend developer is someone who works with how a website looks, by using for example HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
                              Frontend is also called <i>”client side” programming</i> and is about what is happening in the browser. Backend is also called <i>”server side” programming</i> and is about what is happening in the server and database.  
                              Usually a UX:er (User Experience designer) designs how the page should look like, and the frontend developer transfer the design into code. </p>
